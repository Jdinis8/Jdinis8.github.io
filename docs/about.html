        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I did my bachelor's and master's degrees in Engineering Physics at Instituto Superior Técnico (University of Lisbon). Here I took my first steps in doing some research in General Relativity, focusing on the free evolution of hyperboloidal slices, under the supervision of Alex Vañó-Viñuales and Edgar Gasperin Garcia. After I finished that, I worked a bit with Jorge Rocha and Tiago Fernandes in the topic of thin-shells in an alternative theory of gravity. I then crossed the Atlantic Ocean to start my PhD in Physics at the University of Mississippi, USA. This is where I am currently at, working with Leo C. Stein.

          I've also been writing the story of the Industrial and Commercial Institute of Lisbon, the forefather of Instituto Superior Técnico, during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This will be published in book form in due time.

          I also work as a freelance graphic designer, mostly making cover art for music albums and posters.
